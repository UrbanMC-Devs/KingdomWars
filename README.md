# KingdomWars
An unofficial Towny war plugin that allows for simple Nation vs. Nation wars. A nation can go to war with another non-peaceful nation. Once the war begins, whichever nation to reach the configured amount of kills will win the war. Rewards include a configurable amount of townblocks and money (via Vault). For more information about how the war system works, see the [Wiki](https://github.com/UrbanMC-Devs/KingdomWars/wiki).

## Building
